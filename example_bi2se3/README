python example_bi2se3.py

Will run bulk bi2se3 and several surface calculations with a 1x1x6 and 1x1x10 surfaces

Exercises:

 - Find the splitting the Dirac code at Gamma as a function of layers

 - Show that the supercell without a surface has no gap states

 - Show that the non-SOC hamiltonian goesn't give a surface state
